<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Sign Up for Upcoming Trainings!</p>

Sign up for our upcoming New User training session on Tuesday, November 1st!

Our New User training's primary objective is to understand job submission principles to the Open Science Pool. This workshop will cover how to visualize distributed computing on the Open Science Pool, distinguish High-Performance Computing (HPC) vs. High Throughput Computing (HTC), identify ideal jobs to run on the Open Science Pool, and identify the basic elements of an HTCondor submit file. This workshop will feature an exercise using text analysis and the next steps you can take to start your workflow.

**[Register here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdj3XT7I0SM4k9jBvST7YX5wsCH_er1HLA7VqRj9ICoEvf2GA/viewform)**

All User Training sessions are offered from 2:30-4pm ET (and usually on Tuesdays). New User Training is offered monthly, generally on the first Tuesday of the month, and training on various additional topics happens on the third Tuesday of the month. It's best to already have an active account on an OSG Connect login node (or other access point that submits to the Open Science Pool) to follow along with hands-on examples, but anyone can listen in by registering.

Other upcoming trainings:
- Tuesday, November 15: Using R on the OSPool, **more information and registration coming soon.**
