### Save the date!

Save the dates for [Throughput Computing 2023](https://agenda.hep.wisc.edu/event/2014/)! For the first time, HTCondor Week and the OSG All-Hands Meeting will join together as a single, integrated event from July 10–14 to be held at the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s [Fluno Center](https://fluno.com/). Throughput Computing 2023 is sponsored by the OSG Consortium, the HTCondor team, and the UW-Madison Center for High Throughput Computing.

The **U.S. ATLAS and U.S. CMS high-energy physics projects** are also planning parallel OSG-related topics during the event on Wednesday, July 12. (For other attendees, Wedneday's schedule will also include parallel HTCondor and OSG tutorials and OSG Collaborations sessions.)

### Workshop Hotel Accommodations

We've arranged hotel reservations at nearby hotels. We strongly recommend you reserve your hotel room **ASAP**, as the number of reserved rooms at the reduced rate is limited. Please visit the Local Arrangements page to find information about how to book your hotel room at the reduced rate for each hotel.

**Please note:** DoubleTree Madison is the only hotel with a *free shuttle service* to and from the airport - all other hotels require you to make your transportation arrangements.
