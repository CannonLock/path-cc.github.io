Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing? Learn how this summer at the lovely University of Wisconsin–Madison!

The OSG User School will occur on August 7–11, where you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems to run large-scale computing applications at your campus or using the national-scale OSG.

At the School, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at your own campus or using the national-scale Open Science Pool — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science.

The School is ideal for researchers (especially graduate students and post-docs) in any research area where large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process, anyone (especially students and staff) who supports researchers and are current or potential users of high-throughput computing, and instructors (at the post-secondary level) who teach future researchers and see value in integrating high-throughput computing into their curriculum.

Applications are now open. The deadline for applications is Monday, 17 April 2023. Submit your application soon to ensure consideration!

To apply, complete the [online application form](https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9shkUL5ZDSghKvk) and have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to [user-school@osg-htc.org](mailto:user-school@osg-htc.org).
