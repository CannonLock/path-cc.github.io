The OSG User School will occur on August 7–11, where you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems to run large-scale computing applications at your campus or using the national-scale OSG.

At the School, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage many jobs, and where to find more information and help through lectures, discussions, and hands-on activities with  OSG staff.

The School is ideal for graduate students in any research area where large-scale computing is an essential part of their research process, plus we welcome applications from advanced undergraduates (especially those who are involved in graduate-level research or coursework), post-doctoral students, faculty, and staff (especially those who perform research or support/facilitate researchers).

Applications are now open. The deadline for applications is Monday, 17 April 2023. Submit your application soon to ensure consideration!

To apply, complete the [online application form](https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9shkUL5ZDSghKvk) and have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to [user-school@osg-htc.org](mailto:user-school@osg-htc.org).
