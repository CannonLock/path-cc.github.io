# PATh - Partnership to Advance Throughput Computing

[PATh](https://path-cc.io/) brings together the Center for High Throughput Computing and the Open Science Grid in order to advance the nationâ€™s campuses and science communities through the use of distributed High Throughput Computing.

Thie website is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) based website.  The theme is based on [Jekyll-Serif](https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/jekyll-serif-theme).  Please create a pull request to modify the website.

# Installation

### Installing Ruby & Jekyll
 
If this is your first time using Jekyll, please follow the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and make sure your local environment (including Ruby) is setup correctly.

### Using Docker for Development

Depending on your environment, it may be more useful to run Jekyll inside a container.  To do this, run the following from your laptop while inside the checked-out copy of the website source:

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 --rm --volume $PWD:/srv/jekyll -it jekyll/jekyll:latest /bin/sh
```

This will utilize the latest Jekyll version and map port `8000` to your host.  Within the container, a small HTTP server can be started with the following command:

```
jekyll serve --watch -H 0.0.0.0 -P 8000
```

This will build and serve the website; it can be viewed by navigating your web browser to <http://localhost:8000>.

With the `--watch` flag set, any changes you make to the website source will cause a new version of the website to be built; it usually takes 4-5 seconds between hitting "Save" and then "Refresh" on the website.

# Making Website Changes

This repository uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/path-cc/path-cc.github.io/tree/master/.github/worfklows)
to deploy a website preview from the `master` branch to the [web-preview repository](https://path-cc.io/web-preview/).
The production website (https://path-cc.io/) is built automatically by GitHub Pages from the `production` branch.

To make changes to the website, use the following workflow:

1.  Submit a pull request with website updates to the `master` branch (the default) and request a review
1.  Upon approval and merge of the pull request, changes can be previewed at https://path-cc.io/web-preview/
1.  If additional changes are necessary, repeat steps 1 and 2.
1.  When satisfied with the preview website, submit a
    [pull request](https://github.com/path-cc/path-cc.github.io/compare/production...master?expand=1)
    from `production` to `master`
1.  After the pull request from step 4 has been merged, verify the changes at https://path-cc.io
