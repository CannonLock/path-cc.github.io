{: .fs-5 }
Our project – the  Partnership to Advance Throughput Computing (PATh) – is funded by the NSF to 
facilitate sharing of research computing capabilities across campuses. As such it is aligned with 
the vision of the NSF Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) 
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504748" target="_blank">(NSF 22-582)</a> program. 
We provide state-of-the-art 
opensource software tools, dependable services, and facilitation to translate the power of 
research computing into advances in education and scientific discovery.


## Assistance for CC* Proposals

{: .fs-5 }
When planning or preparing a proposal for the NSF CC* program, please feel free to contact 
us with any questions you may have about the program and the services we can provide your proposed project once awarded.

{: .fs-5 }
Once we agree on how the PATh project will be involved in your proposed project, we 
will be happy to provide a letter of commitment. Please share with us in advance 
the text referring to our involvement, the title of the proposal and the name of 
the PI.

### CC* Campus impact on Open Science

{: .fs-5 }
The OSG Consortium has been working with CC* campuses pre and post award for several years. 
These campuses have made significant contributions in support of science, both on their 
own campus and for the entire country.

#### Computing

{: .fs-5 }
In the last year, twenty-two campuses contributed over 235 million core hours to researchers 
via the [OSPool](/services/open_science_pool.html) (April 2021 - March 2022). These contributions supported more than 230 
research groups, campuses, multi-campus collaborations, and gateways, and in fields of 
study ranging from the medicine to economics, and from genomics to physics. Every month,
OSG services help additional campuses to support open science by sharing their resources 
via the OSPool.

#### Data Storage

{: .fs-5 }
As of March 2022, the [Open Science Data Federation](/services/osdf.html) integrates 10 data origins, making data 
accessible via 20 caches, 6 of which are strategically located in the R&E network backbone.
The CC* solicitation of 2022 (NSF 22-582) encourages responses that would add data origins 
or caches at campuses.
