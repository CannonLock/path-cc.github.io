title: Glossary and Concepts
---

<p>Since the inception of “High Throughput Computing” in 1996 the PATh partners have coined many
  terms and concepts to help better describe their computational methodology. Below are the terms
  that have been introduced and a description of each.</p>

<div class="bg-white-offset row p-2 mb-2">
  <div class="col-12">
    <h5 id="high-throughput-computing-htc">High Throughput Computing (HTC)</h5>
    <p>Maximizing the throughput of a computing resource toward a common problem.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="bg-white-offset row p-2 mb-2">
  <div class="col-12">
    <h5 id="distributed-high-throughput-computing-dhtc">Distributed High Throughput Computing (dHTC)</h5>
    <p>Specialized by the <a href="#osg-consortiumosg-htcorg">OSG</a>, this involves many independent, collaborating administrative domains.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="bg-white-offset row p-2 mb-2">
  <div class="col-12">
    <h5 id="osg-consortium"><a href="https://osg-htc.org">OSG Consortium</a></h5>
    <p>A consortium dedicated to the advancement of all of Open Science via the practice of <a href="#distributed-high-throughput-computing-dhtc">distributed High Throughput Computing</a>, and the advancement of its state of the art.</p>

    <p>The OSG Consortium provides a fabric of services, including a software stack, that organization scan use to build dHTC environments.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The OSG owns no clusters and pays no staff.</li>
      <li>It is coordinates the efforts contributed by projects such as the NSF-funded IRIS-HEP and PATh.</li>
      <li>OSG also runs the <a href="#open-science-pool-ospool">Open Science Pool</a>.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="row bg-white-offset p-2 mb-2">
  <div class="col-12">
    <h5 id="htcondor-software-suite-htcss"><a href="https://htcondor.org">HTCondor Software Suite (HTCSS)</a></h5>
    <p>Provides technologies for creating a dHTC environment.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-12 col-md-8">
    <h5 id="access-point">Access Point</h5>
    <p>Provided by <a href="#htcondor-software-suite-htcsshtcondororg">HTCSS</a>, allows users to place workloads such as jobs, job sets, and DAGs. Can access one or more resource pools to acquire resources.</p>

    <h5 id="execution-point-ep">Execution Point (EP)</h5>
    <p>Provided by <a href="#htcondor-software-suite-htcsshtcondororg">HTCSS</a>, executes jobs.</p>

    <h5 id="central-manager">Central Manager</h5>
    <p>Provided by <a href="#htcondor-software-suite-htcsshtcondororg">HTCSS</a>, locates daemons and allocates shares of the overall resource pool.</p>

    <h5 id="compute-entrypoint-ce">Compute Entrypoint (CE)</h5>
    <p>Provided by <a href="#htcondor-software-suite-htcsshtcondororg">HTCSS</a>, submits ‘pilot jobs’ to a remote compute resource.</p>

  <div class="col-12 col-lg-7">
    <h5 id="open-science-compute-federation-oscf">Open Science Compute Federation (OSCF)</h5>
    <p>The OSCF provides a set of services for requesting and allocating computing resources and creating <a href="#distributed-high-throughput-computing-dhtc">dHTC</a> environments.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="#compute-entrypoint-ce">CE</a>, hosted on-prem or off-prem, provide a way for the factory to
        send resource requests to a compute resource.</li>
      <li>The factory acts on behalf of an organization the requests resources.</li>
      <li>If HTCSS is used by the organization the resource start and <a href="#execution-point-ep">EP</a> and join the <a href="#central-manager">Central Manager</a>.</li>

<div class="row bg-white-offset p-2 mb-2">
  <div class="col-12 col-lg-7">
    <h5 id="open-science-pool-ospool">Open Science Pool (OSPool)</h5>
    <p>An environment for any scientist or group doing open science in the US.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Any campus, group, or collaboration can attach an access point to the OSPool and receive a share of the resources.</li>
      <li>OSG operates the OSG Connect AP, meant to provide a place for PI-driven groups to place their jobs.</li>
      <li>Users can Bring Your Own Resources (BYOR) to utilize their own resources (such as an XRAC allocation) via the OSPool.</li>
